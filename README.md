Introduction<br>
Hey there! I'm Anasmit, and this is my journey into the exciting world of web development. As of today, I'm on my 5th day of this incredible learning experience, and I'm thrilled to share with you my first project â€“ a Netflix clone!

Project Overview<br>
Project Name: Netflix Clone<br>
Languages Used: HTML, CSS<br>
Current Learning Focus: JavaScript<br>
Why This Project?<br>
This project represents my initial steps into the vast realm of web development. With a background in HTML and CSS, I took on the challenge of creating a Netflix clone to not only showcase my skills but also to learn more about responsive design, layout, and styling.

Learning Progress<br>
HTML & CSS: I've honed my skills in creating structured and visually appealing web pages. The Netflix clone allowed me to experiment with layout and styling techniques.<br>
JavaScript: Currently, I'm diving into JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to my projects. I'm excited about the endless possibilities that JavaScript brings to the table.<br>
